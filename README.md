# RocketCollision
A simple game where a rocket travels one side of window to other side avoiding asteroids 
Click on "src/main/java" file in the master repository to open all the classes of the game.
"Game.java" is the class that runs the game
All other files are classes and objects that allow the game to run
Upon opening the files, you would see the code that makes up for the game. The purpose is to show the coding strategies I used to code this game.
